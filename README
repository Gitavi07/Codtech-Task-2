### Overview

This project aims to predict the placement status of students based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) using Simple Linear Regression. The dataset includes information such as CGPA and whether a student was placed or not.

### Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the likelihood of a student being placed based on their CGPA.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
- Showcase proficiency in using Python for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

### Key Activities

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset containing CGPA and placement status.
   - Handle any missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Explore the distribution of CGPA and placement status.
   - Visualize the relationship between CGPA and placement status using scatter plots.

3. **Model Building**
   - Implement Simple Linear Regression to predict placement status based on CGPA.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and visual inspection of residuals.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model.
   - Provide insights into how CGPA influences placement status.
   - Discuss potential use cases and limitations of the model.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Key Insights

- **Predictive Power:** Determine how well CGPA predicts placement status.
- **Model Interpretation:** Understand the impact of CGPA on the likelihood of placement.
- **Application:** Discuss potential applications in educational institutions for predicting student placement outcomes.

### Usage

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`).

2. **Run the Notebook**
   - Clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook (`analysis.ipynb`).
   - Execute cells to load data, build the model, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
